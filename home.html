              WhatsApp is a popular messaging app owned by Meta (formerly
              Facebook), allowing users to send text messages, voice messages,
              images, documents, and make voice and video calls. It works over
              both Wi-Fi and mobile data, enabling communication across
              different devices worldwide. One of WhatsApp's defining features
              is its end-to-end encryption, ensuring privacy in messages and
              calls.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially launched in 2009, WhatsApp has grown to become one of
              the most widely used messaging apps, with over 2 billion active
              users. It’s available on Android, iOS, Windows, and web platforms.

              Instagram is a social media platform launched in 2010 that allows
              users to share photos and videos, connect with friends, and
              discover content from around the world. Users can upload photos,
              videos, and reels, which can be edited with filters and captions,
              and shared with their followers. The platform also features
              Stories, which are temporary posts that disappear after 24 hours.
              In addition to sharing content, users can send private messages,
              participate in group chats, and make video calls through Instagram
              Direct.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, Instagram has expanded its features, adding the
              Explore page to help users discover new content, and integrating
              shopping options for businesses to sell products directly on the
              platform. Hashtags and user tagging increase visibility and
              engagement with posts, and the introduction of short-form Reels
              has made Instagram a strong competitor to TikTok. With over a
              billion monthly active users, Instagram has become a key platform
              for influencers, brands, and everyday users alike.

              Facebook, launched in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg and his college
              roommates, is one of the largest and most influential social media
              platforms globally. Initially created as a social networking site
              for college students, it quickly expanded to include users from
              around the world. The platform allows users to create profiles,
              connect with friends, share posts, photos, and videos, and engage
              with a wide variety of content, including news, entertainment, and
              live events. Facebook's user base has grown to billions, making it
              a central hub for personal communication and a key player in
              digital marketing and advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, Facebook has evolved to include many features,
              such as Facebook Messenger, groups, pages for businesses and
              public figures, and its Marketplace for buying and selling goods.
              It also acquired other popular platforms like Instagram and
              WhatsApp, further expanding its reach. However, Facebook has faced
              criticism for issues related to privacy, data security, and the
              spread of misinformation. Despite these challenges, it remains a
              dominant force in shaping how people interact and consume
              information online.

              Temple Run, developed by Imangi Studios, is another hugely popular
              endless runner game. Released in 2011, the game sets players in a
              temple scenario where they control an explorer fleeing from
              demonic monkeys after stealing a cursed idol. The game's premise
              draws inspiration from classic adventure movies like Indiana
              Jones, and its jungle temple setting enhances the feeling of
              danger and excitement. Players swipe to turn, jump, or slide to
              avoid obstacles like tree roots, cliffs, and fire traps while
              trying to outrun the pursuing creatures.

            <p>
              The simple controls and immersive 3D environment made Temple Run a
              groundbreaking game at the time of its release. The game's
              addictive nature stems from its challenge to beat one's high score
              and run as far as possible. Power-ups, coins, and unlockable
              characters add extra layers of gameplay, offering variety and
              rewards for continued play.
